                    <p>The pollution caused by industrial and household waste is called as ‘garbage pollution’. It is one of the serious issues for the environment. Garbage Pollution is caused by ignorance of government, cleaning authority and societies living in a particular area. If the pile of trash is not processed timely, it will spoil the environment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="dark">    Marine life is highly depleted by dumping plastic and other solid waste into it. Exposing the trash in open is also one of the reasons behind soil infertility. Rotting garbage gives rises to the air toxicity. In a real sense, garbage pollution is the result of unprocessed garbage in a particular area.</p>
